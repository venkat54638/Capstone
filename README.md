Here's a structured overview of the project:

### **Project Title**
ML Project Template  
A comprehensive template for building web applications with machine learning models using Python and Flask.

---

### **Project Description**
This web application provides a framework for deploying predictive models. It allows users to upload datasets, preprocess them, and deploy trained models via API endpoints. The solution leverages open-source libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Flask to build a scalable system.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform raw data into actionable formats.
2. **Model Training**: Utilize robust algorithms to train accurate models.
3. **Model Deployment**: Expose API endpoints for making predictions post-model training.
4. **CI/CD**: Currently lacks automated continuous integration, but infrastructure exists for future implementation.
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error management ensures stable application operation.

### **Prerequisites**
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pip install pandas scikit-learn pyarrow joblib Flask SQLAlchemy

# Install Flask dependency used in app.py
pip install Flask

# Install database connector (if SQL is used)
pip install SQLAlchemy
```

---

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ml_project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### **Usage Examples**

#### **Prediction Endpoint Example**
Make a POST request to `/predict` with JSON-formatted data:

```json
{
  "feature1": 0.5,
  "feature2": 1.0
}
```

```bash
curl -d '{"feature1": 0.5, "feature2": 1.0}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict
```

#### **Health Check Endpoint**
Check the server status at `/health`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

---

## **API Documentation**
The application exposes the following endpoints:

- `/`: Main page view.
- `/predict`: Prediction endpoint requiring valid input features.
- `/admin`: Admin dashboard (requires authentication).

Endpoints are defined within `app.py`.
